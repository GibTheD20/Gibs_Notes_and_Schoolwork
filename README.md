# Just_a_student_learning
This is just a repository for all of my schoolwork and small projects to further my knowledge outside the scope of my classes. Feel free to chime in and point me in directions i should pursue to broaden my knowledge. 
This will all be in python for now and in the future i will be adding the other languages i learn, i also plan on posting my learning journey through machine learning and SQL so any advice on practical knowledge in the world of computer science would be greatly appreciated.
