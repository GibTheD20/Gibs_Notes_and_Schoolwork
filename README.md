# Just_a_student_learning
This repository contains my schoolwork and small personal projects as I continue expanding my programming skills beyond the classroom.

Everything here is written in Python for now, but I’ll be adding other languages as I learn them. I also plan to document my progress in machine learning and SQL.

Feedback, suggestions, and advice on practical computer science topics are always welcome — I’m here to learn and grow.
